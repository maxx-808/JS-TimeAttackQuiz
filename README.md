# JS-TimeAttackQuiz
homework 4 Web APIs, Javascript quiz timed


this is my homework for week 4 Web API's
It is a mulitple choice 7 question timed quiz with a highscore leaderboard
60 seconds to take the quiz and 5 seconds deducted for every wrong answer
the score is your time left and you can type in your initials to save to local storage together
this quiz is about Javscript and should be fairly easy for anyone who did a small bit of learning about Javascript

I could not get the code to work that brings back the highscores from local storage nor could I set it up to take the top 10 highest scores.
